This is the repository for the Shiny app Global Vaccination Tracker Dashboard. This app tracks progress towards vaccination targets by income group, country and region. Two goals are laid out by the WHO: 40% vaccination by the end of 2021 and 70% by mid-2022. As such, two thresholds are set in the gauges. One displaying the 40% goal, the other (full circle) showing the progress needed to meet this second goal.
